    <h1>Embedding Video in HTML5</h1>

    <video src="30seconds.mp4" controls>
        <!--<source type='video/mp4' />-->
        The codec for this video is not supported
    </video>

<!--    <video width="400" height="300" poster="frame.png" autoplay controls loop>
        <source src="video.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora,
     vorbis"'>
        <source src="video.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E,
     mp4a.40.2"'>
    </video>-->

    <p>
        There's no video codec format standard.  Internet Explorer supports the popular
        H.264
        codec (typically .mp4, but other formats may include H.264 as well).
    </p>

    <p>
        This will only work for "progressive downloads" (aka, "pseudo-streaming", not true
        streaming (using a media server, so no RTMP/E/T/S, MMS, etc.).  Therefore no DRM,
        etc.  Maybe some day ...

    <ul>
        <li>poster - what is to be displayed during download of video</li>
        <li>controls - turns on the video player controls</li>
        <li>autoplay - starts playing video as soon as completely downloaded</li>
        <li>preload - start downloading video immediately so that its ready when the user wants
            to play it</li>
        <li>loop - continuous loop</li>
        <li>muted - not working yet in IE, turns off volume</li>
        <li>autoplay - starts playing video as soon as completely downloaded</li>
        <li>width / height - control dimensions</li>
    </ul>
